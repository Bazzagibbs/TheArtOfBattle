## Introduction
While many other combat card games focus on the larger battle between terrified pawns and hordes of vicious monsters, The Art of Battle zooms in to a macro level. We’re looking at the split second decisions a soldier makes. A warrior deflects an enemy’s blade as his comrade catches his breath from a flurry of clashing metal and mind games. He readies himself, and draws his blade high above his head. As his opponent instinctively begins to angle his blade to deflect the warrior’s blow, he shifts his weight and plants his shoulder square in the chest of his adversary. With this game, the player is in control of every action their character makes.  

## Game Objective
This game is played by four players, separated into two opposing teams. The team with the last man standing wins. Each player has their own Health counter and Stamina counter. When a player's Health counter falls to zero, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when both players from a team are eliminated.

## The Battlefield
The battlefield is layed out so you can see which player is being targeted and how long each action will take before it hits, or is 'resolved'. There are three main components of the battlefield: Lanes, Rows and the Resolution zone. Lanes are used to show the focus of an attack or defense, while rows are used to display the passage of time. For example, a stronger card may require it be played in a row further back than its weaker counterpart, giving the enemy more time to react. A heavy slash will take longer to hit its target than a quick jab.

 At the end of every turn, each card on the battlefield moves forward a row and any cards that enter the Resolution zone are resolved.

## Battlefield Layout
The battlefield consists of four 'lanes', each of which is segmented into three 'rows' labeled '1', '2', and '3'. Teammates sit next to each other on one side of the table, and the enemy team sits on the opposite side. Each player's lane is organised so that row 1 is closest to the centre of the battlefield, and row 3 is closest to the player. Each team should now have two lanes; left and right. These lanes should be opposite a corresponding enemy lane, with enough space between them to place a card.  

Each player should have enough space between themselves and their lane to move cards around. This will be referred to as the 'play area'. Somewhere in this play area, each player will have two counting devices or objects to keep track of their Health and Stamina, such as a 20-sided die or a spinner. These should start with their maximum values of 20 points each, or Health reduced to 10 for a shorter game. Each player will also place their deck and discard piles within this area, or to the side of their lane.


## Card Types
In this game, each player has their own (identical) deck of cards. Within a player's deck, there are three card types as indicated by the pip on each card: **Weapons** represented by a sword, **Proficiencies** by a chain, and **Directions** by a letter L or R. There are two **Last Stand** cards represented by a flame, but these cards do not belong to any individual player until later in the game. 

Most cards have a Stamina cost, indicated at the bottom-left of each card. When a card is played, this cost is subtracted from your Stamina points. If the player has less than the required amount of Stamina, the card cannot be played.

Some cards will have a Row requirement, indicated by an icon at the bottom-right of the card. These cards may only be played into one of the rows highlighted.

**Weapon** cards are the player's core cards, they are used for attacking, defending and recovering Stamina. Each player may only have a single Weapon on the battlefield at a time. When a Weapon is resolved, it returns to its wielder's hand.

**Proficiency** cards have two possible attributes: *Modifier* and *Action*. Modifier Proficiencies are played onto a Weapon that is on the battlefield and take effect when the Weapon it is attached too is resolved, while Action Proficiencies take effect as soon as they are played. Proficiencies can be applied to either allied player, provided the card's owner can afford the Stamina and any Row requirements are fulfilled. When a Proficiency's effect has occurred, the card is placed in the owner's discard pile.

**Direction** cards are played at the same time as a Weapon or Proficiency. They are used to declare the target of the accompanying card. If the accompanying card is a Weapon, it is played in the lane specified on the Direction card. If it is a Modifier Proficiency, it is applied to the leftmost or rightmost Weapon, as specified on the Direction card. A Direction card may be played accompanying an Action card to withhold information from your enemy.

A **Last Stand** card is chosen by a player when their teammate is eliminated and both enemies are still standing. One card goes to the player's hand, while the card that did not get chosen is removed from the battlefield. Once a Last Stand's card has expended its effect, it is removed from the battlefield as well. One of the Last Stand cards has the *Passive* attribute. This card is placed to the side of the lane, and takes effect while the condition is fulfilled. As soon as the condition is not fulfilled, the card is removed from the battlefield.

## Starting Hands
The two Last Stand cards are placed face-down at the centre of the battlefield.

Each player takes all Weapons and Direction cards from their decks and places them in their hands. Proficiency cards should be shuffled, then placed face-down in their play area. Each player draws three Proficiency cards before the game starts.

Each player's hand should now consist of:
* 7 Weapon cards
* 2 Direction cards
* 3 Proficiency cards

## Playing the Game
The order of events that a player does in a single turn is as follows:
1.	**PLAY:** All players may choose to play a single card from their hand face down, as well as a direction card which faces either LEFT or RIGHT, depending on which lane you want the card to be played on.
2.	**REVEAL:** All players reveal their cards simultaneously and place them in the intended rows, paying the appropriate stamina costs. Weapon cards may be placed in either allied lane, and Modifier Proficiencies may be attached to any allied Weapon. Action Proficiencies take effect immediately as they are revealed.
3.	**MOVE:** All cards move forward one row, unless otherwise stated by a card’s effect. 
4.	**RESOLVE:** Any cards that have moved beyond the foremost row will now trigger their “Resolved” attributes, along with any Modifier Proficiencies attached. Weapon cards are returned to their owner’s hand, while any attached Modifiers are discarded.
5.	**DRAW:** All players that did not play a Proficiency this turn may choose to discard one Proficiency. Any players with less than 3 Proficiencies in their hand may draw a card from the Proficiencies deck.

If any players’ Proficiencies deck become empty, shuffle their discard pile and return it to the deck.

## End of Game
A player is eliminated when their Health drops to 0. An eliminated player’s Weapon cards are removed from the board, but any Modifiers that are attached to their teammate’s Weapon remain. The last team standing is victorious!
